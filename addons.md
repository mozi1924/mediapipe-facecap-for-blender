# Add-Ons (Blender) Usage Guide

While this program is developed with modularity, it does not currently support traditional add-ons. At this stage, there is no immediate need to implement add-on functionality.

This document focuses on the **receiver** component.

**Note:** The current receiver addon is not fully stable. We recommend avoiding its installation as a standard Blender addon.

Follow these steps to use it in Blender:

1. **Create or open your Blender project**
2. **Switch to the Scripting workspace**
3. **Create a new text block**
4. **Paste the contents of `addons.py` into the text editor**
5. **Click the â–¶ (Play) button to execute the script**

The `FaceCapture` panel will then appear in the sidebar tabs.
